### What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual components or functions of an application 
are tested in isolation to verify that each unit performs as expected. In Android development, unit 
tests focus on testing logic within classes and methods without relying on the Android framework, 
ensuring code reliability, maintainability, and early detection of bugs.
